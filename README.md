# Task.2-EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)-Using-Weather-dataset-
Hey! This is my second task where I explored the dataset using stats and visuals to understand what’s going on with the data — like trends, outliers, and relationships between features.
I used a Weather dataset for this task.

1. Imported the dataset using Pandas.

2. Checked basic info — data types, column names, first few rows, etc.

3. Printed out summary stats like mean, median, standard deviation using `describe()`.

4. Looked for missing values in the dataset using `isnull()`.

5. Plotted histograms to see how the numeric values are distributed.

6. Created boxplots for numeric columns to spot any outliers visually.

7. Generated a correlation heatmap using Seaborn to find relationships between numerical features.

8. Made a pairplot to understand how features relate to each other — especially top 4 numeric columns.

9. Built an interactive scatter plot using Plotly to visualize the relation between Temperature and Humidity (if those columns exist).

10. Wrote down a few quick inferences based on the plots — like possible correlation between temp & humidity, spotting outliers in rainfall, etc.
